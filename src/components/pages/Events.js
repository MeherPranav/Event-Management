   <p1>
   Business event management is the practice of incorporating business logic into labeling events, communicating events and  <br/>
   handling events. In software systems, events are created,prioritized, and managed by software developers who often have <br/>
   no inkling of business priorities and concerns; business event management takes a different slant on traditional event <br/>
   management. As such, business event management requires a  profound interaction and cooperation among business<br/>
   stakeholders as well as software development and IT management professionals when designing, implementing, and maintaining <br/>
   computer systems and processes.<br/>
